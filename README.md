SUMMATIVE   ASSIGNMENT   (RESIT   AUG   2024) - ECON44815
Advanced   Macroeconomics

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS



Your completed assignment must be   uploaded to   Learn   ULTRA
no   later than   11:59am (UK time) on 23rd   August 2024.
A   penalty will   be applied for work   uploaded after   11:59am as detailed   in the
Programme   Handbook.    You must   leave sufficient time to fully complete   the
upload   process   before   the deadline and check that you   have   received a
receipt. At   peak   periods,   it can take   up to 30   minutes for a   receipt to   be
generated.Assignments   should   be   typed,   using   1.5   spacing   and   an   easy-to-read   12-point   font.   Assignments   and   dissertations/business   projects   must   not   exceed   the   word   count   indicated   in the module   handbook/assessment   brief.
The word count should:
         Include all the text, including   title, preface, introduction, in-text citations, quotations,   footnotes and any other   items not   specifically   excluded   below.
         Exclude diagrams, tables (including tables/lists of contents and figures),equations,   executive   summary/abstract,   acknowledgements,   declaration,   bibliography/list   of   references   and   appendices.   However,   it   is   not   appropriate   to   use   diagrams   or   tables merely as away of circumventing the word limit.   If a student uses   a   table   or   figure as a means of presenting his/her own words, then this is   included in the word   count.Examiners will stop   reading once the word   limit   has   been   reached,   and   work   beyond   this point will not be assessed. Checks of word counts will be carried out on submitted   work,   including any assignments or dissertations/business   projects   that   appea代 写ECON44815 Advanced Macroeconomics 2023/24Python

Where      a      student      has      intentionally   misrepresented   their   word   count,   the   School    may   treat   this   as   an   offence    under   Section IV of   the General   Regulations of   the University. Extreme cases may be viewed   as dishonest practice   under Section   IV, 5   (a) (x)   of the   General   Regulations.Very   occasionally   it   may   be   appropriate   to   present,   in   an   appendix,   material   which   does not properly belong in the main body of   the assessment but   which some students   wish to   provide for the sake   of   completeness.   Any   appendices   will   not   have   a   role   in   the assessment - examiners are   under   no   obligation   to   read   appendices   and   they   do   not   form   part   of   the   word   count.   Material   that   students   wish   to   be   assessed   should   always   be included   in the main   body   of the text.
